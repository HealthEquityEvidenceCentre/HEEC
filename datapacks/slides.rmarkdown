## Introduction
- Strong primary care is associated with more equitable health outcomes.

- A key role of commissioners is to ensure the equitable distribution of resources across the system.

- We present the latest NHS primary care data, using Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) to examine inequalities existing in primary care access, experience and outcomes, across the following categories:
  - **Resources (supply)**:	Payments, Workforce
  - **Population (demand)**: Disease prevalence, Health-related behaviours
  - **Service quality**: QOF achievement
  - **Access**: Patient experience, Appointments
  - **Impact on secondary care**: Emergency admissions, A&E attendances

- For further information or to discuss the results, please contact [Dr John Ford](j.a.ford@qmul.ac.uk)

Each practice in England is assigned an Index of Multiple Deprivation based on the population served, which we divide into deprivation quintiles. **`r round(result[result$ICB.NAME == params$ICB_NAME, ]$perc[5], 0)`**% of practices in `r params$ICB_NAME`, serve the most deprived quintile of patients in England.

If data for the most deprived quintile is missing, we use the second most deprived. If both are missing, we omit the data point from the figure.

## Inequality in Life Expectancy

```


Average life expectancy for men is **`r round(df_filter[df_filter$Indicator == "Life_Expectancy_Male", ]$quin_5, 1)`** in the least deprived 20% and **`r round(df_filter[df_filter$Indicator == "Life_Expectancy_Male", ]$quin_5, 1)`** in the most deprived 20%.

If there are no dispensing practices in the most deprived quintile, we use the second most deprived. If both are missing, we omit the data point from the figure.
