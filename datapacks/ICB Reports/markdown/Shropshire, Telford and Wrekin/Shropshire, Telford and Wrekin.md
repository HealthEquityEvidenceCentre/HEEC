## Introduction

-   Strong primary care is associated with more equitable health
    outcomes.

-   A key role of commissioners is to ensure the equitable distribution
    of resources across the system.

-   We present the latest NHS primary care data, using Index of Multiple
    Deprivation (IMD) to examine inequalities existing in primary care
    access, experience and outcomes, across the following categories:

    -   **Resources (supply)**: Payments, Workforce
    -   **Population (demand)**: Disease prevalence, Health-related
        behaviours
    -   **Service quality**: QOF achievement
    -   **Access**: Patient experience, Appointments
    -   **Impact on secondary care**: Emergency admissions, A&E
        attendances

## ICB Overview

::: cell

![](figure-markdown/overview-1.png)
:::
:::

Each practice in England is assigned an Index of Multiple Deprivation
based on the population served, which we divide into deprivation
quintiles. **9**% of practices in Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin, serve
the most deprived quintile of patients in England.

If data for the most deprived quintile is missing, we use the second
most deprived. If both are missing, we omit the data point from the
figure.

## Inequality in Life Expectancy

::: cell

Average life expectancy for men is **77.3** in the least deprived 20%
and **77.3** in the most deprived 20%.

Average life expectancy for women is **81.5** in the least deprived 20%
and **81.5** in the most deprived 20%.

## Inequality in NHS Payments

20% of practices, versus £**166.18** in the least deprived 20%.

If there are no dispensing practices in the most deprived quintile, we
use the second most deprived. If both are missing, we omit the data
point from the figure.
