## Introduction

Primary care, in contrast to specialty care, is associated with a more
equitable distribution of health across populations. One of the key
roles of commissioners is to ensure that resources are distributed
equitably across the healthcare system.

This report presents the latest NHS primary care data, using the Index
of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) to examine inequalities in patient health
determinants and outcomes. We analyze the data according to the
following categories:

-   **Resources (supply)**: Payments, Workforce
-   **Population (demand)**: Disease prevalence, Health-related
    behaviors
-   **Service quality**: Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF)
    achievement
-   **Access**: Patient experience, Appointments
-   **Impact on secondary care**: Emergency admissions, A&E attendances

:::

Each practice in England is assigned an Index of Multiple Deprivation
(IMD) based on the population it serves, divided into deprivation
quintiles.

For Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes, approximately **5%** of
practices serve the most deprived quintile of patients in England.
