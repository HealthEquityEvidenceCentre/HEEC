# NHS Digital workforce data
[NHS Digital](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/general-and-personal-medical-services) provides public CSVs on the primary care general practice workforce.

Data is reported annually from September 2015-2020, quarterly from December 2020-June 2021, and monthly from July 2021 henceforth.

The practice-level headcount of fully-qualified permanent GPs (excluding GPs in training & locums) is denoted by the TOTAL_GP_EXTGL_HC column.
